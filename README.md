### Notes
Need to run the complaint-system backend to get it really works.

Due to limited time did not implemented next things:

Validate data if was not supplied or supplied partially.
Click on buttin will reuquest more details or will display the whole data of the card.
Enable pagination between the cards and limit data load is important but was not implemened due
Design the objects like scroler and all components to be more pretty and designed well.
